#Guess Who? AI Edition.

Just a simple rails app to test a basic form of AI. It analyzes a database on animals, identifies the relationships between traits that commonly appear, and then uses that information, plus some other basic rules, to use the fewest number of questions possible to guess what animal the user is thinking.
